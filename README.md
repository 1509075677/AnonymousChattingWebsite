**Motivation**

Helping people anonymously mainly introverted people to talk to others.

**Description of the proposed solution with the technology stacks to be used.**

Javascript for the front-end design Javascript and PHP for the back-end development. 

**End goals for the project (how will the demos look like?)**

A website that requires you to log in.Then click a button to blindly find people to talk to based on their interest. To get to know their interest these questions will give multiple questions when they create their log in account and each time they press the button. If someone has the same response or high correlation to the other response then they match and they talk. If they both like each other they get more time to talk and will have the option to friend each other and then they will uncover their real identity instead of being anonymous.

**Four major milestones to reach the end goals (in line with the Sprint cycles)**

**Sprint 1:** Getting familiar with PHP and all the front end/back end designs codes.

**Sprint 2:** Starting to code the front end design.

**Sprint 3:** Mostly finished with the code of the front end, starting code with the back end.

**Sprint 4:** Checking everything works and concluding both front end and back end.
